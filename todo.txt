- Need proper state machine for enemies
    
    This will handle all enemy logic, including moving, taking damage (modifying health), switching curr animation clip, etc.

    Will also make it simple to add in enemy AI later.

    I guess for multiplayer, will need to make a seperate type of enemy that still has a state machine for taking damage, switching textures, etc. but without enemy AI (player controlled)


    =====> Implemented state machine talked about above, but it's kinda hacky and I'd like it to be cleaner.
           Also a lot of bugs with shooting; shooting through tiles with dead enemies and doors doesn't work


- Add a time module that normalizes game time. Takes in vsync monitor refresh rate as input and returns a normalized time interface for all parts of the engine that rely on time
